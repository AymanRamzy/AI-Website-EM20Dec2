## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "I don't see the Register button"

**Reason 1:** Wrong page
- ❌ You're on `/competitions` (public marketing page)
- ✅ Go to `/dashboard` (after login)

**Reason 2:** Competition not open
- ❌ Blue badge "Upcoming" = Can't register yet
- ✅ Green badge "Open for Registration" = Can register

**Reason 3:** Already registered
- If you already registered, you see "Create Team"/"Join Team" instead
- This means registration was successful!

### Problem: "Create Team dropdown is empty"

**Reason:** You haven't registered for any competitions yet
- Go back to dashboard
- Click on a competition
- Register first
- Then come back to create team
