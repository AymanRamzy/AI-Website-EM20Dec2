# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   run_ui: false

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:

##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Build a CFO Competition Management System with authentication, team management, competition creation,
  task assignment, judge scoring, and leaderboard features. 
  
  CURRENT FOCUS: Admin View for CFO Applications within Competition Flow
  - Admins must be able to review CFO applications per competition, inside the normal Competition flow
  - No global dashboards, no analytics screens
  - Simple lists, competition-scoped, same design as Teams list
  - Admin sees "View Applications (X)" button on competition details
  - Applications list page with simple filter (All | Submitted | Qualified | Reserve | Excluded)
  - Application detail page with Qualify/Reserve/Exclude actions

      Phase 1.6 - Database Architecture Refactoring Complete
      
      COMPLETED:
      - Refactored backend to use single MongoDB client with dependency injection
      - Updated all API routes in cfo_competition.py to receive database via dependencies
      - Added {"_id": 0} exclusion to all MongoDB queries to prevent serialization issues
      - Backend restarted successfully, no errors in logs
      - API health check passed (GET /api/ returns Hello World)
      
      READY FOR TESTING:
      Complete end-to-end authentication flow testing needed:
      1. User Registration Flow:
         - Test POST /api/cfo/auth/register with valid data
         - Test duplicate email rejection
         - Test password hashing
         - Create test user credentials
      
      2. User Login Flow:
         - Test POST /api/cfo/auth/login with registered credentials
         - Verify JWT token generation
         - Test invalid credentials rejection
      
      3. Protected Route Access:
         - Test GET /api/cfo/auth/me with valid token
         - Test token validation and user retrieval
         - Test unauthorized access rejection
      
      4. Frontend Integration:
         - Test registration form submission
         - Test login form submission
         - Test AuthContext state management
         - Test ProtectedRoute redirect behavior
         - Test Dashboard access after login
         - Test logout functionality
      
      5. Team Management APIs (lower priority):
         - Create competition (admin user needed)
         - Create team
         - Join team
         - Assign roles
         - Leave team
      
      BACKEND URL: https://app-fix-12.preview.emergentagent.com
      
      Please perform comprehensive testing of the authentication flow (items 1-4) as highest priority.
      Create test credentials and share them with the user for manual verification.
