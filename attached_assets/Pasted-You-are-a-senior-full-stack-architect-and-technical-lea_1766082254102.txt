CFO COMPETITION – GLOBAL RULES
====================================================
- Competitions run monthly / bi-monthly
- Max 40 participants per competition
- Max 8 teams per competition
- Max 5 members per team
- User can join ONLY ONE team per competition
- Enforce all rules in backend

====================================================
CFO APPLICATION & QUALIFICATION SYSTEM (CRITICAL)
====================================================
Before joining any CFO Competition, users must be qualified.

FLOW:
1) User applies to CFO Competition
2) User completes CFO questionnaire
3) User uploads CV (PDF/DOCX)
4) System auto-scores candidate
5) Admin reviews & adjusts scores
6) System selects / approves / rejects / waitlists candidates
7) ONLY approved CFOs can create or join teams

DATA MODELS:
- cfo_applications:
  {
    id,
    user_id,
    competition_id,
    cv_file_path,
    years_experience,
    job_title,
    industry,
    certifications[],
    leadership_answers[],
    availability_score,
    auto_score,
    manual_score,
    final_score,
    status:
      PENDING |
      AUTO_REJECTED |
      SHORTLISTED |
      APPROVED |
      REJECTED |
      WAITLISTED,
    created_at
  }

AUTO-SCORING LOGIC:
- Years of experience (weighted)
- Certifications (FMVA, CMA, CFA, CPA, etc.)
- Leadership willingness
- Availability & commitment
- Industry relevance

ADMIN CFO DASHBOARD:
- View all applications
- Filter & sort by score, experience, certifications
- View CV inline
- View full questionnaire
- Adjust scores manually
- Auto-select top N candidates (e.g. top 100 of 1000)
- Export results (CSV / Excel)
- Audit log for decisions
